title: "Agility: One Week Later"

It's been a fun and interesting week since reading Dave Thomas's post that
sparked myself and several others to write our own. I got to see complete
strangers on Twitter talking and finally saying that they would love to work
together sometime. Developers were passionate about wanting the authentic Agile
at the hole in the wall kitchen, not the Agile slop they serve up at those
tourist trap restaurants. If any teams have taken time since last week to
reflect on their own current practices, I would love to hear about them and how
that went.

Discussion is always a good thing, but *action* is even more important. I've
been getting into the habit of using the word agility whenever this topic comes
up. Most people are looking at me like I'm the idiot that doesn't know what's
going on. In a year's time, I imagine we can enjoy giving the cocked-head stare
to anyone still using the old word.

### This Isn't a War of Words
Let's be clear about something: this isn't just a witch-hunt on vocabulary,
it's about communication. Using agility to describe the way you work is
acknowledging to others that you understand, appreciate and practice the Agile
Manifesto. We all agree that the original values and principles of the
manifesto are what's important to us, not nomenclature. We're merely using
nomenclature to differentiate between salesmen and us.

Something I find great humor in is that you could read the values and
principles presented in the Agile Manifesto ten times over before you could
read the [Wikipeda page for Agile software
development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) once.
Anything that is easy to understand usually requires a lot of discipline to
follow through on. Agility is no exception.

Let's face it, telling people to slow down and think more just isn't all that
attractive. What is attractive are spiral notebooks with fancy branding and
playing games where the objective is to get balls into buckets as fast as
possible (I had to do this in Scrum training once). We should take pride in
doing the dirty work and asking ourselves and our team the hard questions.

### A Call to Action
If you haven't already since last week, find one thing in your current
development process that is getting in the way of getting good software built.
Get your team together and talk about this and come up with some ideas on how
to make it better. Don't spend too much time on this, though. By doing this
over and over occasionally, we can *steal* back what we thought we were getting
in the first place. All of a sudden we have agility!

One thing is clear: the first time around the Agile merry-go-round, we
developers didn't do a good job of protecting what's important to us.
Agile-to-Go kits, trainings and useless meetings seemingly crept in through the
night. Agility is our second chance at having an environment that is in our
interest.
