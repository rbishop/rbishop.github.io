title: "Agile Is Dead: The Angry Developer Version"

Yesterday, [Dave Thomas wrote an incredible
post](http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/) about the death
of "Agile" and the birth of "Agility." Words have never resonated so well with
me, and while I don't have to say this for everyone to agree, truer words have
never been said about the current landscape of software development. Dave is
100% spot on about everything he wrote. My wife is also incredibly happy to
know that my constant complaining about software development has been validated
by another breathing human.

While I have never met Dave Thomas, from reading his books (thanks Dave!) and
writings I get the impression that he is a pretty nice guy. Unfortunately for
you, I'm not. You see, I work incredibly hard at my craft and if I could live
in my parent's basement making cool open source tools all day long none of this
"Agile" shit would matter to me. But, alas, it does because I need money and
"Agile" is what helps me put up with the disarray that the world of business
people is.

But as Dave has so kindly pointed out, my "Agile" and your "Agile" aren't the
same thing. My Agile (I'm going to stop quoting it now) is iterating quickly,
constantly reflecting and collaborating with the customer to deliver software
in a timely manner. Your Agile is name tags, notebooks, seminars, SaaS project
management tools and Barney the Dinosaur scratch-and-sniff stickers for all
that I know.

### The Agile Bait-and-Switch
In my short career I've been on a number of job interviews and have worked on
several teams at different companies. Guess what? All of them have claimed they
are Agile. I've done my best during the interview process to get a feel for how
they work without jeopardizing my candidacy for the job. My only regret is that
I should have jeopardized my candidacy more by pro into their interpretation of
Agile.

I've been in a three day long sprint planning meeting for a 6 week "sprint."
I've seen user story cards with nothing but "Make dashboard better" written on
them by Certified Scrum Masters. It's pathetic. Even more pathetic is that I
accepted their job offer, but I didn't know any better. They told me they were
Agile, after all.

### Organizing Around Tools Instead Of People
The above header is certainly not one of the tenets of Agile Manifesto. Yet,
every time I talk with a so-called Agile company about how they work I get a
laundry list of SaaS Web applications. Trello, Basecamp, JIRA, Pivotal -- none
of these tools existed when the Agile Manifesto was carved into Kent Beck's
chest while he was being forcefully held onto an Altair 8080 by the other
fifteen Agile Manifesto founders (it's still unclear which founder did the
carving).

These tools aren't the solution. Agile doesn't need a solution, it *is* the
solution, or rather a guiding light to the solution for your particular team.
These tools are masquerading around pretending to be the solution to *people*.
People that haven't learned what Agile is all about. These people just hit the
Wikipedia page for Agile after seeing it mentioned in a job post because their
degree in Communications couldn't get them any other gig.

### The Path To Happiness
There's probably a person on your team that once raised their hand and said
something about building software better. They likely mentioned ideas about
building features with higher certainty, less meetings, and more learning. Go
find that person. They are likely a member of your local Agile user group.
Unlike you, they've taken the time to understand what Agility is all about and
they were interested in helping you until your team stared at them like a pack
of Antelope.

Change starts with us, the bastions of Agility with a capital A. It's our
responsibility to inform business leaders of what agile is. Agile is so simple
and beautiful that it is [summed up eloquently in a Geocities-esque web
page](http://agilemanifesto.org/) that hasn't changed, ever. The charlatans
pimping courses and seminars needs to be ostracised. The best advocates of
Agility are us: *the developers*. Developers created the Agile Manifesto, let's
carry that torch forward for them.
