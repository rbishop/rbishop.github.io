Yesterday, [Dave Thomas wrote an incredible post](http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/) about the death of "Agile" and the birth of "Agility." Words have never resonated so well with me, and while I don't have to say this for everyone to agree, truer words have never been said about the current landscape of software development. Dave is 100% spot on about everything he wrote.

While I have never met Dave Thomas, I get the impression that he is an incredibly nice guy. Unfortunately for you, I'm not. You see, I work incredibly hard at my craft and if I could live in my parent's basement making cool open source tools all day long none of this "Agile" shit would matter to me. But, alas, it does because I need money and "Agile" is what helps me put up with the disarray that the world of business people is.

But as Dave has so kindly pointed out, my "Agile" and your "Agile" aren't the same thing. My Agile (I'm going to stop quoting it now) is iterating quickly, constantly reflecting and collaborating with the customer to deliver software in a timely manner. Your Agile is name tags, notebooks, seminars, SaaS project management tools and Barney the Dinosaur scratch-and-sniff stickers for all that I know.

### The Agile Bait-and-Switch

### Organizing Around Tools Instead Of People
The above header is certainly not one of the tenets of Agile Manifesto. Yet, everytime I talk with a so-called Agile company about how they work I get a laundry list of SaaS Web applications. Trello, Basecamp, JIRA, Pivotal -- none of these tools existed when the Agile Manifesto was carved into Kent Beck's chest while he was being forcefully held onto an Altair 8080 by the other fifteen Agile Manifesto founders (it's unclear which founder did the carving).

These tools aren't solutions to Agile. Agile doesn't need a solution, it *is* the solution, or rather a guiding light to the solution for your particular team. These tools are masquerading around pretending to be the solution to *people*. People that haven't learned what Agile is all about, they just hit the Wikipedia page for Agile because their degree in Communications couldn't get them a different job.
